.
## Installation

To install my code you can use clone the repo using either the HTML or ssh key to add to your local machine.

## Usage

The main usage of this project is to show that I am able to create a portfolio of work to showcase my skills and talents to employers. I was tasked to use HTML and CSS to create a functioning website that not only displayed my work but also a picture and a breif description of myself for anybody to view.
With these points in mind, in this Challenge I will set myself up for future success by applying the core skills I've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.
## Credits

I was able to accomplish my goal with the help of this video and website as a reference when working on my project.
