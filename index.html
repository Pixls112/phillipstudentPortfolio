                    Hey, I'm Phillip Nguyen. 
                    I'm passionate about playing games, especially things related to Souls-like or Dungeons and Dragons. 
                    I also love building PCs and customizing them to my own needs. 
                    When I'm not gaming or building PCs, I like to read manga or watch anime shows. 
                    I'm always looking for new ways to have fun and explore the world of gaming. 
                    No matter what I do, my goal is to make sure that everyone around me is having a good time.
                </p>

                <h3>Main Project</h3>
                <p> This was my first major project. 
                    The goal of this project was to refactor/improve the existing code of the given Horiseo wep-page without changing any of the current functions. 
                    Through-out this assignment I was able to combine certain Class and id elements in the style.css document to help cut down lines 
                    and not only that but I was able change the html. </p>
