                    Hey, I'm Phillip Nguyen. 
                    I'm passionate about playing games, especially things related to Souls-like or Dungeons and Dragons. 
                    I also love building PCs and customizing them to my own needs. 
                    When I'm not gaming or building PCs, I like to read manga or watch anime shows. 
                    I'm always looking for new ways to have fun and explore the world of gaming. 
                    No matter what I do, my goal is to make sure that everyone around me is having a good time.
