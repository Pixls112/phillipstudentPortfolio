                    Hey, I'm Phillip Nguyen. 
                    I'm passionate about playing games, especially things related to Souls-like or Dungeons and Dragons. 
                    I also love building PCs and customizing them to my own needs. 
                    When I'm not gaming or building PCs, I like to read manga or watch anime shows. 
                    I'm always looking for new ways to have fun and explore the world of gaming. 
                    No matter what I do, my goal is to make sure that everyone around me is having a good time.
                </p>

                <h3>Main Project</h3>
                <p> This was my first major project. 
                    The goal of this project was to refactor/improve the existing code of the given Horiseo wep-page without changing any of the current functions. 
                    Through-out this assignment I was able to combine certain Class and id elements in the style.css document to help cut down lines 
                    and not only that but I was able change the html. </p>

                <h3>Weather Project</h3>
                <p>For this project we were tasked with creating an application using API's and a CSS framework. My group had decided to make a weather application that would allow the user to see the wweather forecase for the current day and the next three days. Not only that but it will also display the air quality of the area at the bottom of the page. </p>

                <h3>Project 3</h3>
                <p> For this project my group created a simple calendar app, which would save events on the corresponding day, and would let multiple users log in and see there own personal calendar. We also allowed the user to create accounts which would be stored onto a database.</p>

                <h3>Project 4</h3>
                <p>For our last project my group created a tournament hosting website where users who want to meet up and participate in player made tournaments could do so. Users would be able to create an account and through that would be given the ability to view public tournaments, create new tournaments, and join existing tournaments. </p>
